If the latest news is any indication, the big moveor any move at allthe Lakers need isn't coming anytime soon. Here's what Adrian Wojnarowski said on ESPN's NBA Countdown (h/t Hoops Rumors' Luke Adams):
Im told to expect Rob Pelinka and the Lakers to wait until post-Thanksgiving, 20 games into the season. And see what teams may start pivoting who dont start off well, who decide that they may start to unload players and perhaps get involved in the Victor Wembanyama sweepstakes.
Um, yeah, no. The Lakers cannot afford to wait 20 games. Seven of their next 18 come against probable tankers, but they could very easily lose the other 11. And starting off 6-13 in this year's hellfire of a Western Conference is akin to consigning yourself to the play-in race. That's inexcusable, always, when you have LeBron. But especially when you have LeBron in his age-38 season.
To be sure, this isn't about Westbrook alone. The Lakers' problems run so much deeper than Westbrook. He's merely a symptom of the disease that is Los Angeles' ass backwards roster construction.
General manager Rob Pelinka and the rest of humanity watched as LeBron made recurring trips to the Finals and won multiple championships in Cleveland and Miami surrounded by shooting and, oftentimes, defensive depth. Heck, Pelinka and the rest of the Lakers front reaped the firsthand benefits of that model in 2020, when they won the NBA title. Their response to watching proven models rack up titles was to drown LeBron (and Davis) with a supporting cast of non-wings and non-shooters each of the past two seasons.
Los Angeles has opened this season shooting 19-of-85 from deep22.4 percent. That is putrid. And totally expected.
